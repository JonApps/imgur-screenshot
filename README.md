the _**Linux Screenshot Uploader**_ (and OS X) from [imgur.com/apps](https://imgur.com/apps)<br>

# Imgur-Screenshot
_A desktop notification_<br>
![Notification](http://i.imgur.com/3DuQj9n.png)


0. select area of your screen
0. The screenshot is uploaded to [imgur](https://imgur.com)

Features
----
* You can edit the screenshot with any program _(GUI or CLI)_ before uploading
* The link can be copied to clipboard
* Normal image files can be uploaded, too
* You can open the URL or file with any program _(browser, image viewer)_ after upload
* The screenshot can be saved or deleted from disk
* All filenames + URLs (and errors) are logged
* The program can check for updates

The edit feature is very interesting for automization with something like [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php), or to add notes with a GUI editor.

Installation
----

Check if you have all dependencies installed:

    imgur-screenshot.sh check

That's it. You can bind the script to a hotkey or add it (or a symlink) to your $PATH for quick access ;)

**Enjoy!**

Usage
----
Take screenshot & upload:

    imgur-screenshot.sh

Upload image file:

    imgur-screenshot.sh filename

```bash
imgur_key="486690f872c678126a2c09a9e196ce1b"
imgur_secret=""
imgur_icon_path="$HOME/Pictures/imgur.png"
logmein="false"
save_file="true"
file_prefix="imgur-"
file_dir="$HOME/Pictures"

upload_timeout="120"
upload_retries="1"
copy_url="true"
open_command="firefox %url"
log_file="$HOME/.imgur-screenshot.log"
check_update="true"
```

Note
----

The screenshot will be taken **after** the selection has been made. This could be annoying if you want to capture something quickly and _then_ want to select an area. I might implement this as a FutureFeatureâ„¢ when I find a decent way to capture the whole screen, display the shot in full screen and then crop it to a selection.

Troubleshooting
----

If you get a notification like

> **Something went wrong :(<br>**
> Information logged to /foo/bar/logfile.log

This probably means that `scrot -s`/`screencapture -s` was unable to make a selective screenshot.

* You pressed the <kbd>any</kbd> key during selection
* (Linux) `sleep 0.1` in the script didn't help. Try increasing the value
* You don't have permission to write the file
* One of the dependencies is not installed
* You don't have your display plugged in (wrong terminal?) >_<
* ?? - run `scrot -s`/`screencapture -s` directly and check the outcome
