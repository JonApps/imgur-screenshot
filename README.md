## Dependencies

* curl
* jq
* **Linux only:**
* libnotify-bin
* scrot (or other screenshot tool)
* xclip <i>(needed for `copy_url`)</i>
* **macOS only:**
* [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) *or* [growlnotify](http://growl.info/downloads#generaldownloads)


## OS support

With the above dependencies installed, imgur-screenshot should work on most UNIX systems.  
This will not work on Windows. (maybe with cygwin?)  
I have successfully tested this on Ubuntu and macOS.  
If this won't work on your OS, [create a new issue](https://github.com/jomo/imgur-screenshot/issues/new?title=add+support+for+_______&body=required+steps+to+make+it+work+on+______:).


## Note

The screenshot will be taken **after** the selection has been made. This might be annoying if you want to capture something quickly and _then_ want to select an area.
However, you can take a full shot and use the edit option to crop the image before upload.
