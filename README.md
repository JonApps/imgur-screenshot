0. select area of your screen
0. The screenshot is uploaded to [imgur](https://imgur.com)

Features
----
* Upload screenshot or image file
* Use any screenshot tool
* Edit image before uploading
* Upload anonymously or to your imgur account
* Copy link to clipboard
* Open uplaoded image
* Delete image from disk after upload
* Filenames, links and **deletion links** are stored
* Get notifications about updates

The edit feature is very interesting for automization with something like [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php), or to quickly add notes.

Installation
----

Clone the repo and check if you have all dependencies installed:

```Bash
imgur-screenshot --check
```

That's it.  
Bind the script to a hotkey or add it to your $PATH for quick access ;)

**Enjoy!**

Usage
----
```bash
imgur-screenshot [--connect | --check | -v ] | [[-o | --open=true|false] [-e | --edit=true|false] [-l | --login=true|false] [--keep_file=true|false] [file]]
```

| command                  | description                                             |

| -v                       | Print current version, exit                             |
| --open=true\|false       | override *open* config <br> -o is equal to --open=true  |

| --login=true\|false      | override *login* config <br> -lis equal to --login=true |
| --keep_file=true\|false  | override *keep_file* config                             |
| file                     | instead of uploading a screenshot, upload file          |

### Uploading a screenshot

All you need to do is simply run `imgur-screenshot`.

### Uploading a screenshot to your account

OS support
----

This will not work on Windows. (maybe with cygwin?)<br>
I have successfully tested this on Ubuntu and OS X.<br>
If this won't work on your OS, [create a new issue](https://github.com/jomo/imgur-screenshot/issues/new?title=add+support+for+_______&body=required+steps+to+make+it+work+on+______:).

Note
----

The screenshot will be taken **after** the selection has been made. This could be annoying if you want to capture something quickly and _then_ want to select an area. I might implement this as a FutureFeatureâ„¢ when I find a decent way to capture the whole screen, display the shot in full screen and then crop it to a selection.

Troubleshooting
----

If you get a notification like

> **Something went wrong :(<br>**
> Information logged to /foo/bar/logfile.log

This probably means that `scrot -s`/`screencapture -i` was unable to make a selective screenshot.

* You pressed the <kbd>any</kbd> key during selection
* (OS X / screencapture) you didn't make a selection or pressed Esc.
  * **Note**: This is a bug which I have reported to Apple. It's fixed in OS X Yosemite
* (Linux / scrot) `sleep 0.1` in the script didn't help. Try increasing the value
  * **Note**: A short sleep is required, otherwise scrot handles the hotkey you're using for imgur-screenshot as <kbd>any</kbd> key to cancel the selection
* You don't have permission to write the file
* One of the dependencies is not installed
* You don't have your display plugged in (wrong terminal?) >_<
* ?? - run `scrot -s`/`screencapture -i` directly and check the outcome
